# React MD Meetup 0

This is the presentation for the zero-th (dry run) of the React MD meetup hosted by Visionist.

## Goals

Introduce basic concepts of React to developers that have never used it before.  Also introduce the very-near necessary ecosystem components such as JSX, Babel, and Webpack.

## How to run

Clone this repository, and then...

```shell
cd react-md-meetup-0
npm install
npm run dev
```

Browse to [localhost:3000/webpack-dev-server/](localhost:3000/webpack-dev-server).

## Adding slides

Add the root component of your slide to the array being exported in `/src/components/Slides/index.js`.  Slides are rendered in the order they appear in that array.
